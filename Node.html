         Node.js is a runtime environment, while JavaScript is a programming language.  <br>
         Node.js provides a platform for executing JavaScript code on the server-side, while JavaScript is primarily used on the client-side. <br>
         Node.js is commonly used developing APIs, but JavaScript access and manipulate the APIs by adding functionality. <br>
         Express is the popular framework of Nodejs, but in JavaScript React library is popular. 
    </p>

    <h3>4. Difference between require and import in Nodejs...?</h3>
    <p>
         By require, we can't load selectively, but with import, we can load selective way. <br>
         Require is synchronous in nature, but import load asynchronously. <br>
         Require is traditional, but import available after introduction of ES6. <br>
         For import availability, we have to add "type": "module" in package.json.
    </p>

    <h3>5. What are the HTTP status codes and explain about types…?</h3>
    <p>
       HTTP status codes provide information about the outcome of a request i.e. success, failure or other status. <br>
       Categories of HTTP status code: <br>
       1xx Informational: <br>
      > 100 Continue: The server connected and the client should proceed to send the request body. <br>
       2xx Success: <br>
      > 200 OK: The request was successful. <br>
      > 201 Created: The request was successful and a new resource was created. <br>
      > 204 No Content: The server successfully processed but no content to send in the response. <br>
       3xx Redirection: <br>
      > 301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location. <br>
      > 302 Found or Moved Temporarily: The requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different location. <br>
       4xx Client Error: <br>
      > 400 Bad Request: The server did not understand the request. <br>
      > 401 Unauthorized: The request requires user authentication. <br>
      > 403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but it refuses to authorize it. <br>
      > 404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server. <br>
      > 429 Too Many Request: <br>
       5xx Server Error: <br>
      > 500 Internal Server Error: A error message indicating a server failure. <br>
      > 501 Not Implemented: The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request. <br>
      > 502 Bad Gateway: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from an upstream server. <br>
      > 503 Service Unavailable: The server is not ready to handle the request due to down for maintenance or overloaded. 
    </p>

    <h3>4. What is the difference between Runtime environment and Framework...?</h3>
    <p>

         It provides a set of features like simple routing system, middleware support, error handling and serve static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images).
    </p>

    <h3>6. What are the differences between Client side and Server side...?</h3>
    <p>
         Client-Side(Browser): <br>
        > It runs on the user's web browser. <br>
        > The primary languages are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br>
        > Responsibility to handle UI display, user interactions and client side logics. <br><br>
         Server-Side(Node): <br>
        > It runs on the server. <br>
        > Primary language is JavaScript. <br>
        > Handle business logic, data storage/access, authentication, authorization etc.
    </p>

    <h3>8. What are Events, Event Emitter, Event Queue, Event Loop and Event Driven in Node.js...?</h3>
    <p>
         Event: Events are objects that represent actions or occurrences that happened in a program. <br>
         Event Emitter: Event Emitter is a core module in Node.js that allows to emit and handle events. <br>
         Event Queue: Event queue holds event listeners/callbacks until they are processed by the event loop. <br> 
         Event Handler(Listener): Function that responds to specific events. <br>
         Event Loop: Event loop manage asynchronous operations in a non-blocking manne by tracking events from event queue and executes in loop. <br>
         Event Driven Architecture: Actions and responses are driven by events rather than a linear flow of code execution.
    </p>

    <h3>9. What is Middleware and how it works in Node.js...?</h3>
    <p>
         Middleware is a powerful tool that executes functionalities between the request and response cycle without modifying the core code in the application. <br>
         Middleware is used to implement a series of functionality, like authentication, logging, error handling and data transformation. <br>
         It takes three arguments: request object, response object and next function. Next is used to call the next middleware function. 
    </p>

    <h3>10. What is the difference between Authentication and Authorization in Node.js...?</h3>
    <p>
         Authentication and authorization are two important concepts for application security. <br>

         It use bcrypt.compare function internally to extracts the salt from the stored hashed password and uses it to hash the entered password for comparison during user login. <br>
         Bcrypt library is a valuable tool for purpose of security, ease of use and performance.  
    </p>

    <h3>12. What is JWT and its importance in Nodejs...?</h3>
    <p>
         JSON Web Token is an open standard for securely transferring data within parties using a JSON object. <br>
         JWT is used for stateless authentication mechanisms for users and providers, means maintaining sessions on the client side instead of storing sessions on the server. <br>
         JWTs consist of three parts: header, payload, and signature. <br>
          ● Header: Contains metadata about the type of token and the cryptographic algorithms used to secure the token. <br>
          ● Payload: Contains the statements about the user and additional data. <br>
          ● Signature: Verifies the integrity of the token and ensures that it has not been tampered with during transmission.  <br>
         Jsonwebtoken library provide two crucial functions jwt.sign() and jwt.verify() for handling JWT in Node.js. <br>
          ● jwt.sign(): This function is used to generate a new JWT token based on the provided payload and options. <br>
          ● jwt.verify(): This function is used to verify and decode a JWT token to retrieve the original payload.
    </p>

    <h3>12. What is Buffer in Nodejs?</h3>
    <p>
         A buffer is a region of memory that is used to store data temporarily in a computer. <br>
         In Node.js, buffers are used to store and manipulate binary data. <br>
         Binary data is data that is made up of bytes, which includes images, audio and video files. <br>
         Node.js provides methods for working with buffers. <br>
          > Buffer.alloc(): Creates a new buffer of a specified size. <br>
          > Buffer.from(): Creates a new buffer from an existing string or array. <br>
          > Buffer.write(): Writes data to a buffer. <br>
          > Buffer.read(): Reads data from a buffer. <br>
          > Buffer.toString(): Converts a buffer to a string.
    </p>

    <h3>15. What are Streaming in NodeJS...?</h3>
    <p>
         Streaming is the process of reading or writing data in small, without loading the entire data set into memory at once. <br>
         This is especially important when working with large files or handling real-time data. <br>
         It helps conserve memory and improves performance by processing data asynchronously. <br><br>
         There are are 4 types of strems: <br>
        > Readable streams: Allow data to be read from a source. <br>
        > Writable streams: Allow data to be written to a destination. <br>
        > Duplex streams: Allowing data to be both read from and written to the same stream. <br>
        > Transform streams: Allow to modify or transform the data as it is read and written.
    </p> 

    <h3>16. Name some of the events fired by Streams...?</h3>
    <p>
         Streams in Node.js emit several events for handling various operations and scenarios. <br>
         Here are some of the common events fired by streams: <br>
        > data: Fired when data is available to be read from the stream. <br>
        > end: Fired when there is no more data to be read from the stream. <br>
        > error: Fired when an error occurs while reading or writing to the stream. <br>
        > close: Fired when the stream and its underlying resources have been closed.
