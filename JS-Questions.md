JS Variables and Keywords:

Important question - Explain Difference between Var, Let and Const.
1. Create a function that calculates the area of a rectangle. Inside the function, use Var to declare variables for the length and width, as they might change. Use Const to declare a variable for the formula used to calculate the area, as it remains constant.
2. Write a for loop to iterate over an array of numbers. Use let to declare the loop variable as it needs to be re-assigned for each iteration.
3. Implement an event listener for a button click event. Use let to declare a variable inside the event listener function to keep track of the number of times the button is clicked.
4. Create a block of code, such as an if statement or a loop. Inside the block, use let to declare variables that are only relevant within that block and shouldn't leak outside.
5. Simulate a scenario where you need to reassign a variable. Use let for such variables. For example, in a game, you might need to update the player's score.
6. Write nested loops where the inner loop reuses the loop variable of the outer loop. Use let for the inner loop variable to avoid unexpected behavior.
7.Use const to declare variables that hold references to objects. Even though the object itself may be modified, the reference remains constant.
8. In try-catch blocks, use let for variables that may be reassigned inside the catch block to handle errors gracefully without causing unexpected behavior.
Scenario based Questions â€“
1.How would you use const to declare configuration values for a web application, such as API endpoints or default settings? Explain why const is suitable for this scenario.
2. In a scenario where you need to iterate over an array and modify its elements, which keyword (var, let, or const) would you use to declare the loop variable? Justify your choice with an example.
3. Explain the difference in scope between variables declared with var and let inside a loop. Provide an example where this difference affects the behavior of the code.
4. Describe a situation where you might need to reassign a variable in your code. Would you use let or const for such variables? Justify your choice with a practical example.
5. How would you use const to declare constants in a JavaScript module? Provide an example of a constant that should not be modified outside the module.
6. When adding event listeners to DOM elements, which keyword (var, let, or const) would you use to declare variables that hold references to the elements? Explain your reasoning
7. Discuss a scenario where block scoping (introduced by let and const) is advantageous. Provide an example where block scoping helps prevent variable leakage and improves code clarity.
8. How can you use let or const in try-catch blocks for error handling? Explain with an example how using these keywords helps manage variable scope and prevents unintended behavior.
9. (I.Q) Describe the concept of hoisting in JavaScript variables. Provide an example where var behaves differently from let or const due to hoisting.
10. Explain why it's beneficial to use const to declare global constants in JavaScript applications. Provide an example of a global constant and explain why it should not be re-assigned.
