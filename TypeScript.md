<h2>TypeScript :</h2>
    <h3>1. What is TypeScript...?</h3>
    <p>
      > TypeScript is a free and open-source high-level programming language developed by Microsoft that adding static type 
      definitions. <br>
      > TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. <br>
      > TypeScript code is transpiled into JavaScript before execution.
    </p>
      <h3>2. Why TypeScript...?</h3>
    <p>
      > Catch errors at compile time, rather than at runtime and write reliable code. <br>
      > Build scalable and maintainable JavaScript applications by adding static type. <br>
      > Allows developers to add optional type annotations, that make code more readable. <br>
      > Allow to define interfaces, which describe the structure of objects.
    </p>
    <h3>3. What is interface in TypeScript...?</h3>
    <p>
      > Interface is a feature of TypeScript that allows to define the structure or shape of an object. <br>
      > It specify the properties and methods that an object has or should have. <br>
      > Extending an interface by using "extends" keyword means creating a new interface with the same properties as the original.
    </p>
    <h3>4. What is type aliases in TypeScript...?</h3>
    <p>
      > Type aliases in TypeScript are a way to give a custom name to an existing type. <br>
      > This can be useful for making your code more readable and maintainable, especially when working with complex types.
    </p>
